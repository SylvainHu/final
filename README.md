Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. **Download and Unzip the Project**

2. **Set Up the Database**
   - Ensure that you have MySQL installed and running.
   - Create a database named `project` by running sql-script:
     ```sql
     CREATE DATABASE project;
     ```

3. **Run the Spring Boot Application**

4. **Set Up the Angular Front-End**
   - Navigate to the `angularclient` directory:
